# hackathon2016

Why did we decide to do this?

The OSU app has a lot of features in it, and is akin to a local guide to OSU campus. While it has a great directory of buildings, it does not have what each building has. OSU has a lot of resources available that are too spread which makes it tedious to search for it all. For example, the other I got a caprese sandwich in Terra Byte Cafe. It comes packed cold, and I was craving a hotter meal. So, I decided to look for a microwave oven on campus.It took me around 30 minutes of surfing on the web to find one nearby. 
This website looks to bring all the secrets and hidden places known only to the most veteran students to the humble freshmen and sophomores at OSU campus. 

What did we implement? What do we plan to do in the future?

The website allows you to search for any facility or service that you want to find on campus. If there are results that have already been added, it shows the building it is in, where exactly in the building the service or facility is available, then how to get it. We used google API for directions and self-implemented linear search function to look in the database. One other thing we added was a sign in and sign up page for students. This step is required to add content. The website simply takes input from students and personnel through a simple form to build up its repositry of facilities/services. 

In the future we plan to add a like or dislike function which would increase or decrease reliability of the information seen. 
We also plan to let the users add pictures to our website when they are adding content.

Challenges we faced:
This is our first hackathon(all three of us), and we did not have much experience with any of the software involved. We were learning on the fly, with limited time, and trying to implement, test, and polish everything at the same time. It was an amazing experience, but also very challenging. We tried our best, and with nothing to lose, we feel that we gained infinited amounts of experience.
